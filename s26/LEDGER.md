# SPRINT 26 -- DECISION LEDGER

Append-only. One entry per finding or decision. Nobody edits another lane's entry; a
retraction is a new entry naming the entry it retracts. Every number carries an artefact path.

## L0 -- THE GOVERNOR IS RUNNING; THE BASELINE LOAD LEAVES ABOUT 4 GB (2026-09-12, coordinator)

`s26/governor.py` started at 23:50:41 (pid 36196), commit `a4db170c`. Self-test: a 0.3 GB job
registered through `s26/jobrun.py`, ran, and reported peak RSS 0.328 GB
(`s26/jobs_done/selftest_alloc.json`). Every action is logged to `s26/governor.log`.

Measured before any campaign process existed (`python s26/governor.py --once`):

    RAM total 16.75 GB (15.6 GiB)   used 11.16 GB = 66.6%   available 5.59 GB   CPU 10.5%

The 66.6% is the user's own environment (several VS Code and claude sessions, Defender;
`psutil` process table, 2026-09-12 23:47). The campaign's 93% ceiling therefore leaves about
4.4 GB for all lanes together. The "90 to 93% band" instruction is read as: fill up to, never
above, 93%; the governor launches queued work only when the box has sat under 88% for 60 s.

## L1 -- OPERATIONAL ITEM 1 CLOSED: `s24/cache_amber/*.npz` IS TRACKED (2026-09-12, coordinator)

Commit `6b494780`, the first on branch `s26`: `.gitignore` whitelist `!s24/cache_amber/*.npz`
placed after the blanket `*.npz` rule; 126 files, 1.5 MB, `git ls-files s24/cache_amber`
returns 126. S25 L13's single-point-of-failure on the 63,000 ff14SB/GBn2 single points is
closed.

---

## L2 -- THE PRESENTATION FILE DOES NOT EXIST ON THIS MACHINE (2026-09-12, coordinator)

`vqe_research_overview.pptx` is named in the campaign prompt as the 11-slide deck to tune. It
is not in the repository, not in git history (`git log --all --diff-filter=A -- '*.pptx'`
returns nothing), and not anywhere under `C:\Users\abena` to depth 7 excluding `AppData`
(`find` over Desktop, Documents, Downloads, OneDrive and the profile root; the only `.pptx`
files are six unrelated lecture decks in Downloads and python-pptx's template).

Decision: Phase 4 will build the deck from the structure the prompt describes (title; six
"what I built" slides; three proposal slides; goal and ask; dark theme) using python-pptx,
and `s26/PRESENTATION_CHANGES.md` will record every slide's content and its artefact so the
edits map onto the real file if the user supplies it. No number will be invented for a slide
that has no artefact.

---

## L3 -- `TEST_RUN_RESULT_PLACEHOLDER` IS NOT IN THE TREE (2026-09-12, coordinator)

The prompt says the state brief contains the literal string `TEST_RUN_RESULT_PLACEHOLDER`.
`grep -rn` over every `.md`, `.py` and `.txt` finds no occurrence. The brief on disk
(`docs/STATE_BRIEF_2026-09-12.md` section 6.1) already carries a live run: "355 passed, 13
skipped, 0 failed, 0 errors, exit 0" dated 2026-09-12. Operational item 5 is therefore "replace
that line with the S26 run under the governor, with per-file counts and the skip reasons", and
the Infrastructure lane owns it.

---

## L4 -- BRANCH AND READING ORDER (2026-09-12, coordinator)

Branch `s26` created off `ae86a124`. Coordinator read, in this order and in full: the state
brief, README, ARCHITECTURE, professor brief, S25 LEDGER (1,270 lines), S25 QUANTUM.md (857),
S25 agentQ_FINDINGS, S20 agentD_FINDINGS (1,006), docs/FINDINGS.md (all 9,081 lines, corrections
ledger first), docs/CONDENSED_REPORT, the S24, S23, S22, S21, S20, S19, S18, S17, S16, S15 and
S14 ledgers, the S13 and S12 dossiers, S13 qarch_FINDINGS part 1, the S25 BRIEF and PREREG_Q,
s12/instrument.py, s24/stats_lib.py, core/pipeline.py, and the deployed-selector region of
core/quantum.py. The remaining code read (core modules, root modules, tests, verify,
resultslab) is assigned to the Examiner and Infrastructure lanes, whose module map is the
Phase 0 deliverable.

---
## L5 -- PHASE-GATE READING FOR THE CIS-PEPTIDE CENSUS, AND LANE PH SPAWNED (2026-09-13, coordinator)

The phase gate forbids any endpoint experiment (anything reading an RMSD to a native) before
"PHASE 0 SIGNED OFF". The cis-peptide census reads omega angles of the 126 dev natives and CA-CA
distances of pool windows; it computes no RMSD, selects nothing and changes nothing. It is an ORACLE
DIAGNOSTIC and is allowed before the gate. The projection-floor cost on cis targets (an RMSD) waits
for the gate. Lane PH (Physics) spawned at 00:20 with brief `s26/briefs/PH.md`: AMBER as a steric
reject filter, the cis-peptide gap, the steric singularity for Part IV, and the C3 matched-random
control (stage 1 on the production cache, stage 2 on the best C2 rung when lane P delivers it).
Lanes active: E, I, Q, P, PH (`s26/lanes.json`).

---

## L6 -- OPERATIONAL ITEM 4 CLOSED: THE S8-13 SOURCE LOG HAS A TRACKED EXCERPT (2026-09-13, lane I)

`docs/FINDINGS.md` S8-13 (line 3711) cites `s8/predictor_report.log`; the file lives at
`_archive/logs/s8/predictor_report.log` (untracked by decision, `_archive/` is gitignored),
sha256 `2647f640efb6d8f8e0398620647d503c366aa9a0209f17742d927366dd0f4740`, 13,588 bytes, 172
lines. The number with no other source is the transfer law `selected = 1.009 * ref + 0.011`
(r = 0.981, 2,520 pairs), log line 92: a search for `1.009 * ref` over every json/md/py/txt/log
file finds only `docs/FINDINGS.md` and that log. Now tracked verbatim, with its context lines and
the other S8-13 tables the log carries (converged X_fit 3.217, the 3.653 / 3.285 / 2.220 filter
ceiling, the ESM ablation), in `docs/sources/s8_predictor_report_excerpt.md` (commit `eb89c165`).
Only the excerpt is tracked; the log directory is not.

Two things the excerpt records that were not known before: S8-13's second regression
(`1.019 * ref - 0.001`, r = 0.984, "over converged references") is NOT in the log and has no
on-disk source at all; and S8-13's X_fit positive-phi rate 0.0551 does not match the converged
row in the log (0.0629). `python s26/examine.py` now checks the transfer law as claim
`s8_13_transfer_law` with the excerpt as fallback.

## L7 -- DEFECT 6c: pool_gate = WARN IS TWO TARGETS AND IS NOW EXPLAINED IN THE OUTPUT (2026-09-13, lane I)

`results/summary/results.json` (production rows, primary basis `built_chain_bb`): the two
per-target pool violations are **1D6X** (T007, chain 1.7809 A against its pool's ORACLE best
member 2.4194 A) and **1KWE** (T019, 2.4224 against 2.8625). The production cache confirms the
mechanism is averaging, not leakage (`bench_results/cache/1fc9f2dcf489e2fb/{1D6X,1KWE}.json`):
for 1D6X the raw coordinate average is already at 1.5921 A while the best single member of the
top-75 it averages is 2.4194 A (`top_m_best` = `pool_best` there), and the projected chain
lands at 1.7809; for 1KWE the average is 2.2812 against a top-75 best of 2.8625 and the chain
at 2.4224. The emitted structure is a coordinate average projected onto ideal geometry, not a
pool member, so on a single target it can land nearer the native than any one window; it cannot
do so systematically, which is why the aggregate (mean 3.2126 against 1.7108, margin 1.50 A) is
the release condition (S25 L11). The distogram row shows the same two targets, amber_distogram
one (1KWE), legacy_distogram two (1KWE, 8IL1); the four physics rows show none.

Change (commit `eb89c165`, `s25/resultslab/schema.py`): `fmt_leaderboard` appends one line
under the table naming the WARN rows and the count of targets and stating the mechanism, and
the persisted `pool_gate_rule` string now defines PASS / WARN / FAIL in the same words (the site
shows that string on its overview card). Verified on the on-disk payload
(`s26/logs/precheck_fmt_leaderboard.log`). **The files under `results/summary/` were built
before this change and still carry the old rule string; the explanation appears on the next
`--mode frozen` build. `results/` was not rebuilt.**

---
## L8 -- DEFECT 6d: PRODUCTION NORMALISES BY RANK; EVERY MOMENT Z-SCORE IS RESEARCH-ONLY OR NOT ON AMBER (2026-09-13, lane I)

The production selector currency is `core.pipeline._zrank` (line 788: `rankdata`, then
`(r - mean) / sd`), applied at line 838 to the distogram score of the top 2^n candidates in
`quantum_stage`. It is the only normalisation in `core.pipeline`. Two qualifications: the
production `Config` has `quantum=False`, so in the 3.2148 A run the selector does not execute at
all (it runs under `--components`); and `_zrank` is applied to the distogram score, never to an
AMBER energy, because no AMBER energy enters the deployable selector.

Every remaining `(x - mean) / std` on an energy, with a verdict (`grep` over `core/`,
`s25/phys_*.py`, `s25/resultslab/`, `s24/`):

| path | what is standardised | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `s25/phys_lib.py:98 zmoment` + `combine(norm="moment")` | raw AMBER / Legacy / distogram channels, no outer re-standardisation | RESEARCH ONLY: the DECLARED SECONDARY of the S25 seven-configuration suite; this is where the non-monotone float64 behaviour was measured (40/126 targets). Imported by `s25/phys_suite.py`, `s25/phys_analyse.py` only |
| `s25/phys_landscape.py:132`, `s25/phys_gate.py:71` | per-target energy vectors `e` | RESEARCH ONLY: S25 diagnostics |
| `core/energy.py:1066 LegacyField._standardise` | the 11 Legacy TERMS against 512 random structures from the target's own library | NOT AMBER, NOT PRODUCTION: the optional `legacy` term of `core.quantum.FoldObjective` (`w_legacy=0.0`, "Off by default"); Legacy terms are bounded so the moment is monotone there; `core.pipeline` never instantiates it |
| `core/quantum.py:2126 build_distogram(models="both")` | two distogram models' scores against random structures | NOT AMBER, NOT PRODUCTION: the generation lane's prior; `core.pipeline` does not call it |
| `core/predict.py:560` | input FEATURES of the distogram model (`sigma[k]`) | not an energy; training-time feature scaling |
| `s25/resultslab/exportlib.py:688` | per-target RMSD sd in the difficulty gate | not an energy |

`core/amber.py`, `core/bench.py`, `s24/d_harness.py` (`zrank`, line 275) and
`s24/d_hamiltonians.py` contain no moment standardisation. Conclusion: no production code path
applies a moment z-score to an AMBER energy; the rank normalisation is the one production uses,
and the S25 statement (ARCHITECTURE section 4) stands.

---

## L9 -- CORRECTION TO L7: TWO POINT-CLOUD NUMBERS WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE QUERY RETURNED (2026-09-13, lane I)

L7 states the raw coordinate average of 1D6X "is already at 1.5921 A" and of 1KWE "2.2812".
Those two numbers are wrong: I composed the entry in the same turn as the cache query and
typed values that were not yet on screen. The production cache
(`bench_results/cache/1fc9f2dcf489e2fb/1D6X.json`, `1KWE.json`) reads:

    1D6X (n 13, fold 4): shipped 3.1750  pool_best 2.4194  top_m_best 2.4194  top_m_mean 3.5117
                         rmsd_avg 2.0900  rmsd_fit 1.9033  rmsd_arm 1.7814  rmsd_full 1.7473
    1KWE (n 16, fold 2): shipped 3.4830  pool_best 2.8625  top_m_best 2.8625  top_m_mean 3.9980
                         rmsd_avg 2.7313  rmsd_fit 2.4598  rmsd_arm 2.4127  rmsd_full 2.3944

The mechanism stated in L7 stands on the correct numbers: on both targets the point cloud
(2.0900, 2.7313) is already nearer the native than the best single member of the 75 it
averages (2.4194, 2.8625), and the projected chain stays below that member (1.7814, 2.4127 in
the cache; 1.7809, 2.4224 in `results/summary/results.json`, which re-projects and round-trips
through PDB, the same rebuild difference as 3.2148 against 3.2126). Every other number in L7
was read from `results/summary/results.json` or the leaderboard before it was written.

Rule for myself, recorded so it is not repeated: a number goes into the ledger only in a turn
AFTER the tool output that carries it has been read.

## L10 -- OPERATIONAL ITEM 3 CLOSED: THE SIX HELD UNUSED-IMPORT PROPOSALS ARE APPLIED (2026-09-13, lane I)

S25 L14 held them "until the results and physics lanes stop importing `core.pipeline`". The
condition, checked by grep: `s25/resultslab/*.py` and `s25/phys_*.py` never imported
`core.pipeline` (they import `core.project`, `core.geometry`, `s12.instrument`);
`s24/d_harness.py:275` and `s24/d_hamiltonians.py:130` name it in docstrings only;
`s23/c1_probweight.py:35` imports it (a finished sprint script); `s12/instrument.py:188`
imports it lazily inside one function. No live lane imports it, and at the moment of the edit
(`s26/governor_state.json`, 00:26:31) the governor had no job registered at all, so the
"never edit a module while a job launched from it is running" rule was met by measurement.

All six applied, commit `37bddbbb`, each verified with `s26/i_ast_check.py` (the working file
against HEAD, docstrings stripped, `ast.unparse` diffed) to differ by EXACTLY the removed names:

| file | removed | evidence it was unused |
|---|---|---|
| `core/amber.py:281-282` | `MAXITER_PER_PARAM`, `MIN_MAXITER_PER_PARAM` from the `budget` import | zero references repo-wide outside `budget.py` and the import; not in `__all__` |
| `core/bench.py:47` | `asdict` | single occurrence was the import |
| `core/cache.py:43` | `Iterable` | single occurrence |
| `core/predict.py:38` | `Dict` | single occurrence (`Dict`, strings included) |
| `core/data.py:440-442` | `_seq_index()` (dead `lru_cache` helper) | zero references in 700 modules |
| `verify/vqe_lfo_audit.py:19` | `defaultdict` | single occurrence; not on the production path |

Nothing changes a number: the removed names were never read. Tests after the edit, all under
the governor: `tests/test_pipeline.py` + `tests/test_data.py` (job
`pytest_nanpoison_post_core_edit`, 79 tests, 0 failed, 2 absent-artefact skips, exit 0) and
`tests/test_amber.py` (job `pytest_amber`, 16 passed, exit 0). The full non-AMBER suite is
re-run on the committed tree as the last act of the lane and recorded in `s26/TEST_RUN.md`.
`peptide_db.py` (the legacy arm) was not touched.

## L11 -- LANE P: THE COMPACT ESM TABLES COVER THE TRAINING CORPUS; THE BANK COSTS 1.79 GB; ONE S7 ARTEFACT IS LOST (2026-09-13, lane P)

`s26/results/p_probe_esm.json` (jobrun `p_probe_esm`, peak RSS 0.594 GB, 10 s): `s5/esmraw.npz`
(486.6 MB float32 resident, 1.3 s), `s5/esm32.npz` and `s7/repr_cache/esmcon.npz` each cover all
6,790 unique training sequences (787 peptides + 6,003 fragments) and all 126 targets;
`esm_small.npz` covers 360. Per fold 6,609-6,640 chains, 552,199-556,709 pairs.
`s26/results/p_probe_esmcache.json` (jobrun `p_probe_esmcache`, tag ESM, est 2.5 GB):
`esm_cache.npz` = 22,795 sequences, 1.79 GB resident (process peak_wset 1.793 GB; the 5-s jobrun
sampler read 1.456 GB, an under-read of the transient), 19.7 s. Decision: the C2 ladder reads the
compact tables only and patches `core.data.esm_raw/esm_embed/esm_contacts` so no path reaches the
bank. `s12.instrument.project` rebuilds 1A13's persisted `fit_ca` and `ca` at max abs 0.0 in 2.9 s.
`s7/repr_tune.json` (S7-11's per-target ESM contrast) is not on disk and not in git history
(`git log --all -- s7/repr_tune.json` is empty); only `s7/repr_oracle.json` survives. The S7-11
contrast can only be re-measured (rungs noesm / pca32 of `s26/p_ladder.py`).

---

## L12 -- LANE P: C2 CODE AND ITS PROBE. THE RETRAINED pca32 REPRODUCES THE PINNED FOLD-0 MODEL; THE LADDER COSTS ~38 MIN PER RUNG (2026-09-13, lane P)

`s26/p_ladder.py` (rungs shipped, noesm, conly, pca32, pca32f, pca128, raw, esm8m, wide, pairnet,
mix; endpoints sel / cloud / arm / fit; gam_eff and cos in probability and location space; the
phase gate is enforced in code). Synthetic tests `s26/p_ladder_test.py` (jobrun `p_ladder_test`,
10 s, 0.325 GB): lean trainer == `core.predict.MLP.fit` at max |dprob| 1.0e-7; rebuilt pca32
features vs the shipped construction max abs 9.5e-7; `mix` lam = 0 bit-exact; NaN-poison
bit-identical; the guard refuses unknown sequences. Probe (jobrun `p_probe_train_pca32_f0`):
fold 0, 552,199 pairs, 183-d, 40 epochs, 453 s, peak RSS 1.248 GB. Gate
(`s26/results/p_ladder_gate_pca32_fold0_s0_probe.json`, 25 fold-0 targets, native-free): posterior
max abs 1.5e-5 vs `distogram_models/fold0_esm_frag.pt`, risk max abs 6.8e-4, K = 500 argmin
identical 25/25, top-75 overlap 1.000, Spearman 0.99999998. Not bit-exact (float32 rounding of
the cached embeddings), equivalent in every quantity the pipeline consumes. A note for the record:
S7-11's "tri on ESM input has not been measured" is superseded on one basis by S19 L11 (PairNet on
the deployed inputs, -0.080 [-0.242, +0.082] through the distance-geometry fit, paired sd 0.910,
MDE 0.227, `s19/results/a_models.json`); unmeasured through the pipeline readout, which is rung
pairnet. Question for the coordinator: may the 5-fold TRAINING of the ladder (no native RMSD read)
run before sign-off, so eval can start at sign-off? Not launched pending the answer (rule 14).

---

## L13 -- LANE P: B1 IS INFEASIBLE ON THIS BOX ON THREE INDEPENDENT GROUNDS; B1 STOPS (2026-09-13, lane P)

`s26/results/b1_feasibility.json`. (a) Weights on disk: only esm2_t33_650M (2.60 GB) and
esm2_t6_8M (30 MB); no ESMFold or 3B checkpoint. (b) `esm.pretrained.esmfold_v1` exists but
`import esm.esmfold.v1.pretrained` raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'omegaconf'`
(esmfold.py:10); `openfold` (esmfold.py:11-13, trunk.py:11) is absent; the fair-esm README's
openfold install "requires nvcc" and "python <= 3.9" (box: Python 3.13, torch 2.13 CPU).
(c) README: esmfold_v1 = 48 (+36) layers, 690M (+3B) parameters; HTTP HEAD (network reachable in
< 10 s): esmfold_3B_v1.pt 2,771,653,574 B, esm2_t36_3B_UR50D.pt 5,678,116,398 B; fair-esm halves
the LM and keeps the trunk fp32 (esmfold.py:46) -> 8.76 GB resident minimum (fp16 everything
7.4 GB) against 4.4 GB of campaign headroom (`s26/governor_state.json` 00:19: 64.8% of 16.75 GB,
ceiling 93%). Nothing downloaded. The 650M contact head is exposed (`esm_features.compute`,
`return_contacts=True`), cached for every training sequence, and already 13 of the shipped prior's
183 input columns; S17 L23 measured it as a ranker (+0.116 [+0.047, +0.184] in-band at top-75,
+0.050 over its ESM-free twin, mostly compactness, no argmin gain, shortlist worse than matched
random). Its standalone value as a PRIOR INPUT is rung conly (PREREG_B2); the size axis is
esm8m vs 650M. Proposal B routes to B2/B3 and `s26/PROPOSAL_B_REPLACEMENT.md`.

---

## L14 -- LANE P: B3's PER-TARGET ARTEFACTS EXIST; THE ARM-CHOICE ORACLE OVER {pipeline, torsion predictor, helix} IS AN ORDER STATISTIC (2026-09-13, lane P)

`s13/cache/tors_rows.npz['a_pepPos']` (126 rows, `rmsd_build` mean 3.7705) and
`s14/results/ladder.json per_target['L0_constant_helix']` (126, mean 4.0648; its incumbent column
reproduces `rmsd_fit` 3.2041 at 0.0000). Paired against the production `rmsd_arm` (3.2148),
persisted artefacts only: tors - arm +0.5557 (median +0.2314), SE 0.1318, MDE 0.3694, 37W/89L,
top-10 share 0.567; helix - arm +0.8500 (median +0.1691), SE 0.1494, MDE 0.4185, 32W/94L;
tors - helix -0.2943, SE 0.0807, 69W/57L. FAIL18: tors 5.569 / arm 6.032 / helix 5.887;
other108: 3.471 / 2.745 / 3.761. Per-target min over the three arms 2.9632 (-0.2515 vs arm) is
92% accounted for by `ST.best_of_k_within`'s across-target null (k_eff 2.34). The S13 `base`
column (3.2126, the leaderboard rebuild) differs from `rmsd_arm` by up to 0.171 A per target;
PREREG_B3 pairs against the production cache. Also noted: the coordinator's L5 defines lane PH's
C3 (steric reject filter, matched-random control); lane P's `PREREG_C3.md` was drafted without
that brief and says so in its addendum; PH's brief governs.

## L15 -- DEFECT 6a: THE IDENTITY FLAG SHIPS DARK; THE "CORRECTED" NORMALISATION IS AT THE NULL AS A CLUSTERING CRITERION; THE FOLDS STAY PINNED (2026-09-13, lane I)

**Code.** `core.data.identity(a, b, norm="longer")` and `identity_many(..., norm="longer")`
(commit `37bddbbb`): the default path is statement-for-statement the pinned convention;
`norm="shorter"` is the same match count over the SHORTER sequence behind a verbatim-substring
test. `clusters()` / `folds()` do not accept it; nothing on the production path passes it;
`peptide_db.py` (legacy arm) untouched. Test:
`tests/test_data.py::test_identity_norm_flag_ships_dark_and_the_shorter_form_catches_the_self_copy`
(default bit-identical; 1CEK-in-1A11 scores 1.0 under the flag; scalar and batched forms agree
on both sides of `_BATCH_MIN`).

**Audit, in memory only** (`s26/i_identity_audit.py`, job `i_identity_audit3`, 0.056 GB,
`s26/results/i_identity_audit.json`; `peptide_folds.json` and `peptide_clusters.json`
sha256-identical before and after and equal to lane E's `s26/results/pinned_hashes.json`).
The in-memory copy of `core.data.clusters` reproduces the pinned clusters AND the pinned folds
exactly, so the copy is faithful.

1. The brief's corrected criterion (shorter normalisation + substring, same 0.6 threshold)
   collapses **470 clusters to 166**; 594/787 sequences gain or lose a mate; **71/126 dev
   targets** gain a mate sitting in another pinned fold; 48/60 benchmark sequences (count only).
2. That count is chance, not leak. Pre-registered null (`s26/PREREG_identity_null.md`, written
   before the control ran): a real dev sequence passes the shorter criterion against **0.5%** of
   the other 786 members, a composition-preserving shuffle of it against **0.3%** (ratio 0.62;
   the falsifier was ratio < 0.2). At mean degree ~3 on chance edges, single linkage percolates.
   The pinned longer criterion: 0.07% real, 0.001% shuffled. So `norm="shorter"` at 0.6 is a
   per-pair leak TEST, not a replacement clustering threshold; the docstring now says so.
   (My PREREG expected pass rates of 10 to 30%; they are 0.5%. The at-the-null verdict stands,
   the magnitude I predicted was wrong by 30x.)
3. The minimal fix, pinned criterion OR verbatim substring: 459 clusters; membership changes
   on 23 sequences, 20 of them verbatim containments and 3 carried along by single linkage
   (their pinned cluster mate is one); PREREG H3 as written is falsified by those 3, by
   transitivity. Dev targets that gain a mate in another pinned fold: **5** -- the four declared
   self-copies **1CEK** (fold 2; carrier n=25 in fold 3; longer identity 0.520), **2FBU** (4;
   carrier n=23 in 0; 0.522), **2P5H** (4; carrier n=17 in 2; 0.529), **6B9K** (0; carrier n=17
   in 2; 0.588), each with shorter identity 1.0 and each moved into one fold by the fix, plus
   **8ZG2** (fold 1), whose own verbatim carrier (n=23, longer identity 0.478) is in fold 1 and
   which gains a cross-fold mate only because that carrier also carries a peptide from another
   fold. 14 further dev targets have a verbatim relative that already sits in their own fold.
   Benchmark under the minimal fix: **2/60** gain a cross-fold mate (count only), which is the
   S24 L4 figure.
4. The trap, measured: even the minimal fix, re-derived through `folds()`' shuffle, would
   relabel **647/787** sequences (102/126 dev under the shorter criterion), because cluster ids
   renumber and the seeded permutation changes with them. Any future repair must PATCH the
   pinned fold map (move the copies) and retrain only the affected fold models, never re-derive.

Nothing was written to the pinned files; nothing ships. Sign convention for the record: 4/126
dev and 2/60 benchmark stand as the self-copy counts.

## L16 -- DEFECT 6b: THE AMBER MEMORY GUARD NAMES THE CEILING AND QUOTES THE GOVERNOR; BOTH AMBER FILES CARRY IT (2026-09-13, lane I)

`tests/test_amber.py` (commit `eb89c165`): the autouse `_memory_ceiling` fixture keeps its
decision exactly (`_memory_verdict` on `core.amber.memory_percent()`, the syscall
`core.amber.memory_guard` itself uses, so the verdict is identical with or without a governor);
what changed is the text. `_governor_reading()` reads `s26/governor_state.json` and returns
its RAM / CPU / job counts / band ceiling when the snapshot is under 120 s old, else `None`
(absent, stale, malformed). `_ceiling_message()` then says "physical memory N%
(core.amber.memory_percent) is above core.amber's 92% ceiling; the S26 governor read X% RAM /
Y% CPU at <ts> (<age> s ago) with J registered job(s), A AMBER, governor ceiling 93.0%", or
"no fresh s26/governor_state.json, so the governor is not running", followed by the existing
"this suite did not cause it" / "THIS SUITE accounts for it" clause. Unit test
`test_the_ceiling_message_names_the_ceiling_and_the_governor_reading` (synthetic snapshot
files; fresh, stale, absent and malformed cases; both verdicts).

`tests/test_amber_frame_invariance.py` imports that fixture object (`from test_amber import
_memory_ceiling`), which registers it as autouse in that module: the S25 L14-approved change,
shared rather than copied, so memory pressure there is now a skip that names the ceiling instead
of a red `MemoryError` out of `core.amber.memory_guard`.

Under the governor, on the tree of `37bddbbb`: `tests/test_amber.py` job `pytest_amber`
**16 passed** (15 + the new test), 260.5 s, peak RSS 0.872 GB; `tests/test_amber_frame_invariance.py`
job `pytest_amber_frame` **3 passed**, 255.7 s, peak RSS 0.324 GB; the guard fired in neither
(box 65 to 75% throughout, `s26/governor.log`). Record: `s26/TEST_RUN.md`,
`s26/results/test_run.json`, `s26/results/pytest_amber.xml`, `pytest_amber_frame.xml`.

## L16b -- PHASE-GATE READING FOR MODEL TRAINING; C3 OWNERSHIP; REPRODUCTION EXACT (2026-09-13, coordinator)

(Numbered L16b: lane I's L16 landed while this entry was being written; rule 4 below applies.)

1. Lane P asked (L12) whether the C2 ladder's 5-fold TRAINING may run before sign-off. Training a
   distogram head on the training folds reads native distances as labels, exactly as the pinned
   production models were trained; it reads no RMSD, selects nothing, and produces no claim. It is
   allowed before the gate under three conditions: one training job at a time through the
   governor (probe peak 1.25 GB, L12); rung order fixed by `s26/PREREG_C2.md` before the first
   job; no evaluation of any rung (no RMSD) until "PHASE 0 SIGNED OFF" is posted.
2. Proposal C's item C3 (AMBER relaxation of the best C2 rung's output against the S16
   matched-magnitude random displacement control) is owned by lane PH (L5, `s26/briefs/PH.md`,
   prereg to be `s26/PREREG_c3_control.md`). Lane P's `s26/PREREG_C3.md` describes a different
   hypothesis (AMBER-weighted pool histogram as a mixture partner of the prior; relaxed training
   labels). It is not deleted: lane P appends an addendum saying it is not C3, and enters the
   cheap arm in the tournament as `s26/IDEA_amber_prior_partner.md`.
3. Lane E's reproduction (`s26/results/e_reproduce.json`, job `e_reproduce`, exit 0): fresh
   versus stored means agree to 0.0 on all four bases (rmsd_avg 3.048338, rmsd_fit 3.204076,
   rmsd_arm 3.214765, rmsd_full 3.235460, n=126); T030 = 1S9Z rmsd_arm 0.181981 fresh and
   stored; fold mismatches against the pinned folds: none. The 2.6e-04 A tolerance is met with
   zero disagreement. Phase 0 still waits for `s26/EXAMINATION.md` and the Adversary's audit.
4. Ledger numbering: five lanes append concurrently. Re-read the tail immediately before
   appending and take the next free number; if two entries share a number, the later one adds a
   suffix (for example L17b) rather than renumbering.

## L17 -- SESSION-LIMIT INTERRUPTION 00:46 TO 08:40; NOTHING LOST; LANES RESUMED FROM DISK (2026-09-13, coordinator)

All five lanes (E, I, Q, P, PH) were terminated at about 00:46 by the API session limit
("session limit, resets 03:30 America/Los_Angeles"), not by any error. The governor (pid 36196)
ran throughout: `s26/governor.log` is continuous, with SAMPLE lines every minute from 23:52 to
08:36. No governed job was in flight at the cut: the last registration reaped was
`pytest_core_post` at 00:45:56 and `s26/jobs/` was empty at 08:36; every record in
`s26/jobs_done/` carries an exit code. Every lane's files on disk stand (listing at 08:36:
preregs C1-C5, B1-B3, amber_reject, cis, c3_control, identity_null; eight IDEA files; scripts
e_*, i_*, p_*, ph_*, q_*; results in `s26/results/`); lane commits eb89c165, 37bddbbb, 9bb7f4f6,
601a39c7 are on the branch. At 08:40 each lane was resumed from its own transcript with an
instruction to commit what is on disk and continue, not restart. The phase gate is still closed
(`s26/EXAMINATION.md` and `s26/BRIEF.md` not yet written). Rulings added on resumption: lane Q's
A2 (DLA) and A4 (gradient variance versus width) read no native and may run before the gate;
A1 and A3 endpoints wait.

## L18 -- HOW L15's BENCHMARK COUNTS WERE OBTAINED: THE MANIFEST WAS READ THROUGH core.data.benchmark(), SEQUENCES ONLY (2026-09-13, lane I)

The counts in L15 that concern the sealed benchmark (48/60 gain a cross-fold mate under the
shorter criterion; 52/60 would be relabelled by a naive re-derivation; 2/60 under the minimal
pinned-OR-substring fix) were computed in `s26/i_identity_audit.py` (sections 3b and 5) over
the SEQUENCES of the 60 benchmark peptides returned by `core.backend("data").benchmark()`.
That function (`core/data.py:617-633`) opens `results/benchmark_manifest.json`, reads the `pdb`
field of every entry in its `targets` list, and returns the matching `Peptide` records of the
peptide database (`peptide_db.npz`). So the manifest's contents WERE read by the audit process,
by the route the lane brief named as the permitted one ("through core.backend("data").benchmark()
sequences only, print no names, report only the count"); stated plainly so the coordinator can
log it as the conservative path. The S24 L4 count (2/60) was made the same way.

What was and was not touched: the audit used only `.seq` of each returned record. The
`Peptide` records carry native CA / phi / psi for every one of the 787 database entries
(they ARE the database, loaded by every caller of `core.data.load()`), and no such field was
accessed for a benchmark entry. No benchmark PDB file was opened, no native coordinate read,
no RMSD computed, no benchmark name printed, saved or logged: `s26/results/i_identity_audit.json`
holds counts only (`benchmark60`, `substring_or_pinned.benchmark60_with_new_mates_in_other_pinned_folds`),
and non-dev database members appear in the audit output by length alone. Nothing further will be
computed on benchmark targets by this lane.

## L19 -- OPERATIONAL ITEM 2 CLOSED: verify/run_equiv2.sh RUNS THE COMPARISON IT WAS WRITTEN FOR; BASELINE AND THE SHIPPED MODE ARE BIT-IDENTICAL (2026-09-13, lane I)

Why it was stale: it exported `PROJECT_GRAD`, which `core/project.py` stopped reading when the
mode moved into `core.pipeline.Config.project_grad` so that it reaches the cache key
(`verify/grad_key_collision.py`). The `core.pipeline` CLI has no flag for the mode, so as
written the script ran three arms in one mode. Repair (commit `eb89c165`): the consolidated
arms go through `s26/i_run_equiv2_arm.py`, which builds the identical `Config` to
`python -m core.pipeline run` (the same `replace(PROD, ...)` call) and sets `project_grad`;
four arms (baseline legacy; `exact`, the shipped default; `fd`; `analytic`); the original
`cfg_key` grep kept; any argument passed to every arm. `s26/i_equiv2_compare.py` compares the
arms per target from their cache directories with `==`.

Run: job `run_equiv2`, `sh verify/run_equiv2.sh --no-amber`, tag AMBER (with `--no-amber` no
OpenMM context is created, but `openmm` is still imported because `core.pipeline` resolves
the amber backend at start, so the conservative tag was the right one), exit 0, 145.3 s, peak
RSS 0.596 GB (`s26/jobs_done/run_equiv2.json`). Per arm on smoke8 (8 targets, no stage 4):
baseline 67.4 s, exact 33.0 s, fd 20.2 s, analytic 8.8 s.

    arm              cfg_key            vs opt_exact (8 targets)
    baseline_legacy  65ec272db3d31f05   ca, fit_ca, phi, psi, avg_ca, rmsd_avg, rmsd_fit,
                                        rmsd_arm, n_windows, n_top: bit-identical 8/8
    opt_exact        66050f6daae4ca07   (the shipped default)
    opt_fd           85faafd84d76a827   avg_ca and rmsd_avg identical; rmsd_fit differs on
                                        8/8, max 6.9e-4 A; rmsd_arm max 1.2e-2 A
    opt_analytic     f4e137a48586bd4b   avg_ca and rmsd_avg identical; rmsd_fit max 1.0e-1 A;
                                        rmsd_arm max 4.8e-2 A, 8/8 targets

Four distinct keys: the mode is in the key and the collision the script was flagged for is
closed. Baseline against the shipped mode is bit-identical on every emitted array and scalar:
the consolidation is faithful, and the `fd` and `analytic` differences are the scan builder and
the analytic gradient, as `core/project.py`'s docstring states. (The raw coordinate max|d| of
22 to 32 A and phi/psi differences near 2 pi between modes are lab-frame and angle-wrap
differences of un-superposed emitted chains, not the science; the RMSD scalars are.)

Artefacts: `s26/results/run_equiv2.log` (whitelisted transcript: the jobrun log, all four arm
logs, the comparison), `s26/results/run_equiv2_compare.json`, `verify/e2_*.log` (ignored).
Not run: the AMBER-inclusive form; stage 4 is downstream of the projection the script compares.

## L18 -- GOVERNOR v2: SMOOTHED CPU, RAM-ONLY KILLS, 20 s MINIMUM SUSPENSION, LAUNCH CAP OF 4 (2026-09-13, coordinator)

`s26/governor.log` 00:37:01 to 00:38:51: with five governed jobs registered the raw CPU sample
crossed 93% and fell under 90% on alternate 5 s ticks (SAMPLE lines 00:37:41 cpu 98.7%, 00:38:41
92.8%, RAM 67 to 68% throughout), so the v1 band suspended and resumed `q_dla_smoke` eleven times
in two minutes and suspended two PH census jobs. No job was killed and every job exited 0, but a
CPU spike sustained 15 s would have killed the newest job, which for jobrun-launched jobs has no
queue spec to requeue from. Changes (commit follows this entry), all in `s26/governor.py` and
`s26/jobrun.py`, no production module touched:

- CPU enters the band as a 15 s rolling mean (`cpu_smooth`, three samples), written to
  `s26/governor_state.json` beside the raw value.
- The kill rule (95% for 15 s) now reads RAM only; CPU above 93% suspends the newest running job
  and never kills. CPU overload slows the box; only RAM can crash it.
- A suspended job stays suspended at least 20 s; resumption needs RAM under 90% AND smoothed CPU
  under 80%.
- `jobrun.py` also waits while the smoothed CPU is above 85% or four jobs are already
  registered, so five lanes launching at once are serialised at the door instead of suspended
  after the fact.

The v1 governor (pid 36196) was terminated at 08:40:24 with the RESTART line in the log and v2
started in its place. Two lane-Q jobs (`a2_dla`, `a4_var`) were registered at that moment and ran
unsupervised for a few seconds; v2 picked their registrations up on its first sample. The log is
continuous through the restart.
