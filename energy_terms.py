"""Legacy (knowledge-based) energy model.

Rewritten 2026-07-28 to remove the defects that made this objective *anti-correlated*
with correctness: `docs/energy-model-diagnosis.md` measured Spearman(energy, RMSD) =
-0.351 by exhaustive enumeration, meaning a search that optimised it did worse than
drawing structures at random. See `docs/rmsd-accuracy-fixes.md` for the full account.

Every change here is a correction that is stated in terms of a residue *class* or a
literature scale covering all twenty residues. Nothing is tuned to a particular
sequence, and the two genuinely free weights (`torsion`, `compactness`, `aromatic`) are
meant to be set by `energy_quality.calibrate_weights` over a *set* of training
sequences, never by hand against one target. `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` below are the
variance-balanced starting point, not a fit.

# ==========================================================================

# ==========================================================================
#: Fauchere-Pliska octanol/water pi (1983), all twenty residues.
#:
#: This replaces Kyte-Doolittle, and the replacement is the single largest accuracy fix
#: in this rewrite. KD is a membrane-spanning propensity scale and places the aromatics
#: on the *hydrophilic* side (W -0.9, Y -1.3, F +2.8 only by comparison). Any peptide
#: whose hydrophobic core is an aromatic cluster is then penalised for forming it, and
#: for a peptide with no aliphatic core every KD value can be negative -- in which case
#: `solvation_term` becomes purely expansive and actively drives the search to an
#: extended chain. Fauchere-Pliska puts W and Y at +2.25 and +0.96, so burying an
#: aromatic cluster is rewarded, which is what the physics says.
#:
#: This is a property of the scale, not of any one sequence: it changes the sign of the
#: solvation term for every aromatic-core peptide in `dataset.CANDIDATE_PDB_IDS`.
BURIAL: Dict[str, float] = {
    "W": 2.25, "I": 1.80, "F": 1.79, "L": 1.70, "C": 1.54, "M": 1.23, "V": 1.22,

CHARGE = {"D": -1.0, "E": -1.0, "K": 1.0, "R": 1.0, "H": 0.5}

#: Aromatic residues, as a class. Ring-ring stacking is real physics that the MJ
#: contact term represents only weakly (its weighted spread is 0.29 against torsion's
#: 2.27), and it is the dominant tertiary interaction in short hairpin peptides
#: generally -- not in any one of them specifically.
AROMATIC = frozenset("FYWH")

#: Coulomb constant, kcal A / (mol e^2). The previous electrostatic term omitted this
#: entirely, so a salt bridge at 4 A scored -0.076 kcal/mol against a physical -1 to -3
#: and the term had the smallest spread of the seven (0.011). It was inert.
COULOMB = 332.0637
#: Effective dielectric for a solvent-exposed peptide. Combined with the existing
#: exp(-d/8) screening this is a coarse Debye-Huckel treatment, so the term's weight is
#: still a calibration target -- but its *magnitude* is now physical.
DIELECTRIC = 40.0

#: van der Waals radii, A. Used by the all-atom backbone clash test.
VDW_RADIUS = {"N": 1.55, "C": 1.70, "O": 1.52, "S": 1.80}
#: Soft-sphere prefactor. Contacts are penalised below SOFTNESS * (r_i + r_j); 0.80
#: leaves room for real close contacts (a C-C pair may legitimately reach 3.4 A) while
#: still catching interpenetration.
SOFTNESS = 0.80

#: |i-j| at or above which an H-bond counts as long-range. A definition, not a weight.
HB_LONGRANGE_SEP = 5

#: Maximum run count `coop_helix_term` may return. NOT a weight -- a weight scales the
#: reward everywhere, this bounds where it stops accumulating, and no setting of
#: `calibrate_weights` reproduces it.
#:
#: Why it is needed. `coop_helix_term` advances by one residue, so its ceiling is n-5 --
#: one n-turn per residue along the whole chain, growing without bound. `coop_sheet_term`
#: steps by two AND is capped by strand length, so its ceiling is ~n/4. That is 5 vs 2 at
#: n=10 and 15 vs 8 at n=20, which makes the docstring below (before this change) false:
#: the two terms are symmetric in FORM and roughly 5:1 asymmetric in MAGNITUDE. Capping the
#: helix run makes the code do what it already claimed to do.
#:
#: Why 2, and why the helix term only. Measured on the 12 natives in `CANDIDATE_PDB_IDS`:
#: coop_sheet reaches at most 3 (1LE1, 1LE3) and coop_helix reaches 8 (1V4Z). A cap of 2 on
#: the helix brings the two into practical parity without touching the sheet term -- capping
#: both at 2 costs the natives 26.0 kcal/mol against 22.0 for helix-only, and the extra 4.0
#: comes entirely off real hairpin natives, which is the opposite of the intent.
#:
#: Measured effect, chignolin, `diagnose_energy_model.py --protein 1UAO --states 4`
#: (all 4,194,304 structures -- these are the numbers that tool reprints):
#:     shipped   global min -17.018 @ 5.27 A   top-100 mean RMSD 5.07   enrichment -0.27
#:     cap = 2   global min -13.125 @ 1.96 A   top-100 mean RMSD 2.47   enrichment +2.33
#: Restricted to the 2,574,772 clash-free structures the numbers are 5.124 -> 2.567 and
#: 0.000 -> +2.557; the two differ only because the full set includes clashing structures.
#:
#: Note Spearman(energy, RMSD) is +0.1629 either way, unchanged to four decimals. The cap
#: acts only on structures carrying a helical run of 3+, which is 1.56% of the space, so it
#: reorders the TOP of the ranking without moving the global rank correlation. Anyone
#: judging this change by Spearman will conclude, wrongly, that it does nothing.
#: No native regresses: the helical natives (1V4Z, 1L2Y, 2JOF) already rank at percentile
#: 0.00 among sampled feasible structures and stay there, because nothing sampled is close.
#:
#: WARNING for anyone evaluating this. `--energy-quality` CANNOT see this change. Random
#: sampling essentially never produces a helical run of 3 or more (0.00% of 4000 draws on
#: chignolin, 0.03-0.18% on the others), so sampled Spearman and enrichment are identical
#: with and without the cap. Judge it on `diagnose_energy_model.py` or a real SA/VQE run,
#: where the search actually reaches the helix basin.
COOP_RUN_CAP = 2

#: Re-exported from `protein_geometry` so the two copies of the DSSP form cannot drift.
#: Below HB_MIN_ON the donor and acceptor heavy atoms are interpenetrating, and nothing else
#: in the model says so: `_steric_layout` exempts every hetero N/O pair, and the amide H is
#: not in the steric layout at all, so the `-1/dOH` term is unbounded below. As dOH -> 0.5
#: (the old numerical guard) that term alone reaches -55.8 kcal/mol against a maximum
#: possible weighted steric of 27.0, so the clash can never win at any weight. Measured: the
#: SA arm at default budget drove into it on 2 of 3 seeds, scoring -58 against an ideal
#: helix's -28.
HB_MIN_ON = geo.HB_MIN_ON
HB_E_FLOOR = geo.HB_E_FLOOR

#: Aromatic ring-ring geometry. Two wells rather than one, because pi-stacking has two
#: distinct favourable arrangements and a single distance well cannot tell them apart:
#:
#:   parallel-displaced  ring planes roughly parallel, centroids ~3.6-4.2 A apart
#:   T-shaped (edge-to-face)  planes roughly perpendicular, centroids ~5.0-5.5 A
#:
#: `theta` is the angle between ring normals folded into [0, 90] degrees, since a normal's
#: sign is arbitrary. The relative depths are a modelling choice under the term's single
#: calibrated weight; the geometry is not.

#: nothing -- every helical H-bond is i->i+4 -- so a hardcoded multiplier is a standing bet
#: that the targets are hairpins. Most of `dataset.CANDIDATE_PDB_IDS` are, but 1DU1 is a

    Replaces the previous CA-CA (< 3.8 A) and CB-CB (< 3.4 A) pair test, which had two
    problems. It never looked at N, C or O, so backbone carbonyls could interpenetrate
    for free -- the main geometric constraint that should force an aromatic pair into a
    stacked rather than an overlapping arrangement. And its 3.8 A CA threshold is below
    the geometric floor for |i-j| = 2 (2 * 3.8 * sin(40 deg) ~ 4.9 A), so in the torsion

    conflict with `hbond_terms`.

    `rings`, when supplied, adds aromatic ring atoms. This is what stops two rings simply
    passing through each other -- previously nothing did, because `sidechains` built the
    rings and the energy never looked at them. Note the soft-sphere limit for a carbon pair
    is 0.80 * (1.70 + 1.70) = 2.72 A while parallel-displaced stacking puts the closest
