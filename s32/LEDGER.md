# S32 LEDGER

Newest entries appended at the bottom. Every entry names its artefacts, its basis, and whether it is
ORACLE. Numbers here are asserted by `s32/s32_verify.py` against the artefact that produced them.

**Endpoint: mean built-chain Cα RMSD, `tuning126`, n = 126. Production 3.2105 Å.**
CA point cloud 3.0483 and set mean 3.5507 are *different objects* and are never differenced against
the chain.

## S32-L0 -- **THE CHARTER IS STORED VERBATIM AND VERIFIED BY READ-BACK** (2026-09-21 08:00, coordinator)

`s32/BRIEF.md`, 2,087 lines, 51,021 bytes, captured on branch `s26` at commit `373d9176`. Stored
with a delimited provenance header and **verified by reading it back**: all **71** section headers
present with none missing, and the charter's own landmarks confirmed — `1. REPOSITORY`,
`71. BEGIN IMMEDIATELY`, `THE FINAL SCORE IS RMSD`, `LOWER BUILT-CHAIN`, `MDE = 2.8016`,
`Never exceed 8`, the closing `I BELIEVE IN YOU` line, and the trailing instruction about testing on
longer proteins.

**Why this is entry zero.** In S30 the coordinator paraphrased the charter instead of storing it and
the sprint then argued about what had been asked for. S31 fixed it and verified the read-back. This
is the third sprint running the fixed procedure. *A charter that exists only in a summary is not a
specification.*

## S32-L1 -- **THE POOL IS NOT THE BOTTLENECK, AND THE PROJECTION COST IS A PROPERTY OF THE OBJECT BEING PROJECTED, NOT A CONSTANT** (2026-09-21 08:00, coordinator)

Extracted from `s29/results/s29_O_ladder_table.json` (S29's O-ladder, 33 rungs carrying both bases).
**This is a cross-sprint quotation and is therefore exactly the class of statement that has been
wrong before** (contract rule 4) — lane V is re-deriving every number from the artefacts that
produced it, and this entry is provisional until it does.

**BUILT CHAIN, all ORACLE rungs ORACLE / NOT DEPLOYABLE:**

```
best sparse convex combination, K=500, s=10   1.1139      <- 2.10 A of headroom
best single member, K=500                     1.7078      <- 1.50 A of headroom
  + retrieval filter K=500 -> 128            +0.4357  ->  2.1435
  + prefix 128 -> 75                         +0.1620  ->  2.3055
  + selection / readout (uniform average)    +0.9051  ->  3.2105   PRODUCTION
```

**Charter §56 asks for the earliest irreversible loss. On this evidence it is not candidate
generation.** The existing K=500 pool supports **1.1139 Å** through a sparse convex combination of
about ten members. Everything downstream of retrieval destroys **2.10 Å that is already present**.
Contract rule 17 is written from this: any claim that generation is the bottleneck must first
explain why 2.10 Å of already-present headroom is not.

**And the second half, which I did not expect and which opens lane R:**

```
PROJECTION COST (built chain minus CA cloud)
  real deposited member (a valid chain)       -0.0007 to -0.0030   ~FREE
  sparse convex combination, K=500, s=10      +0.0002              ~FREE
  sparse convex combination, K=500, s=20      -0.0052              ~FREE
  dense prefix average, K=500                 +0.1701
  PRODUCTION (75-member uniform average)      +0.1622
```

**The projection is free for anything near the manifold of valid chains and costs 0.16 Å for a dense
average, which is not one.** A mean of 75 structures has a contracted backbone (S31: contracts at
*every* separation, least at long range), so the projection must re-expand it, and that repair is
**5% of the endpoint**. Contract rule 16 is written from this: *"the projection costs 0.16 Å" is not
a constant and must not be quoted as one* — every readout proposal states which regime it lands in.

**What this does NOT yet establish.** That the 0.1622 is recoverable. S31 already refuted the
obvious lever: per-target `m` transfers at **+0.0075, 0.22× MDE, 63W/63L — a literal coin flip** on
the endpoint, and the ORACLE global `m` is −0.0044 at 0.19×. So the cost cannot be dodged by
averaging fewer structures. Lane R owns whether it can be dodged at all.
