"""Shared evaluation-budget accounting for every energy model.

The comparison in README.md is quantum-vs-classical *at equal cost*. The only
hardware-agnostic currency available here is the number of distinct structures whose
energy had to be computed: under the amber model that is one OpenMM
backbone-restrained minimization each, and it dominates wall-clock for every arm.
Cache hits are free -- re-visiting a structure costs nothing -- so only cache misses
are charged.

Every search method (CVaR-VQE, simulated annealing, random search) is handed the same
budget through the Hamiltonian it shares. Whichever finds the lowest energy inside that
budget wins, and no method can buy a better answer with a larger optimizer allowance.

This is also what makes the VQE optimizer allowance well-posed. Previously ``maxiter``
was chosen per-arm and set the VQE's cost independently of what the baselines received;
now ``maxiter`` is set deliberately high and the shared budget is the binding
constraint. If COBYLA spends its whole allowance constructing an initial simplex in
120 dimensions while annealing converges inside the same budget, that is a genuine
result about optimizer choice rather than an artifact of how the arms were configured.

Readout reservation
-------------------
A run must be able to report its answer even after the optimizer has spent everything.
``reserve(k)`` withholds ``k`` evaluations behind a soft limit for the duration of the
search; ``release()`` hands them back for the final read-out. Charges still stop at the
hard limit, so the reserve bounds the read-out rather than exempting it.
