## S30-L0 -- THE CHARTER, TWO READING-LIST CORRECTIONS, AND THE ARITHMETIC THAT SHOULD GOVERN THE SPRINT: **FIXING TEN TARGETS BEATS IMPROVING ALL 126 BY 0.20 Å** (2026-09-20 12:35, coordinator)

### The charter
Saved verbatim as `s30/BRIEF.md`. One hard constraint (CVaR-VQE remains the spine and main
scientific object), one endpoint (mean built-chain Cα RMSD, 126 targets), current production
**3.2105 Å**, primary target < 3.0, ambitious < 2.5. Section 8's twelve leads are explicitly a
**leads register, not a task list**; the charter states that a sprint ignoring ten of them and
finding the mechanism is a success, and one executing all twelve and finding nothing is not.

### Two corrections to the reading list, made by checking rather than assuming
The charter names `s27/REPORT_S29.md` and `s27/LEDGER.md through the S29 close`. Neither is right:
the S29 report is at **`s29/REPORT_S29.md`** (1,619 lines) and `s27/LEDGER.md` is **S28's** ledger
(4,215 lines, ends S28-L50) while S29's is **`s29/LEDGER.md`** (5,823 lines, S29-L0..L57). Both
were read. There is no separate S29 retractions file; S29's 18 withdrawals live in its report
§14(e). Recorded because this project has four instances of prose naming a path that does not
exist, one of which cost a mis-planned lane-week.

### Section 7's meter already exists
`s29/s29_D_cost_audit.py` (767 lines) implements the cost-RMSD meter. S30 **verifies and extends**
rather than rebuilds; lane D owns it and copies it to `s30/s30_D_meter.py` so the S29 artefact
stays untouched.

### THE ARITHMETIC — computed at the open from lane O's S29 rows, before any new experiment

```
production, n = 126      mean 3.2105   median 2.9661
the worst 18 targets     mean 6.2758
the other 108            mean 2.6997

cap the worst 10 at 3.00 A  ->  mean 2.9074  (-0.3031)   BEATS the charter's primary target
cap the worst 18 at 3.00 A  ->  mean 2.7426  (-0.4680)
cap the worst 30 at 3.00 A  ->  mean 2.5778  (-0.6328)
worst 18 all the way to 2.50 ->  mean 2.1334  (-1.0772)

versus improving EVERY ONE of the 126 by 0.20 A  ->  mean 3.0105  (-0.2000)
```

**Fixing ten targets is worth more than improving all 126 by 0.20 Å.** For an endpoint that is a
mean over a distribution with median 2.9661 and a tail reaching 8.24 Å, a mechanism that works on
the typical target and leaves the tail alone is close to worthless, and a mechanism that only works
on hard targets can hit the primary target on its own.

**The caveat, stated with the number so it is not over-read:** capping is an ORACLE operation. It
bounds the prize; it does not deliver it. Two routes realise part of it — (a) a native-free regime
detector, or (b) a method simply better on hard pools *without needing to know they are hard*.
Route (b) requires no detection and is the stronger target.

**And a live, unexplained clue:** the record says the shipped pipeline is **worse than a
sequence-blind one on its 18 hardest targets** (blind 5.425, shipped 6.019) while sequence
conditioning is worth +0.776 Å overall. Something the pipeline does on hard targets is actively
harmful.

### Opening lane assignment (7 of a permitted 8; one slot held for what results demand)

| lane | remit |
|---|---|
| **R** | is nativeness recognizable from a single structure at all (L11) — judged to sit underneath the rest |
| **L** | literature, permanent role |
| **D** | adversary, permanent; owns and extends the cost/RMSD meter |
| **T** | theory: the bit accounting (L8), and when the CVaR tail stops being a prefix |
| **F** | the failure tail — highest leverage on the endpoint by the arithmetic above |
| **X** | divergent, permanent: should the quantum stage select at all, or generate? |
| **Q** | L5 + L6 **together** — a subset objective is pointless through an averaging readout, and a sparse readout is unusable without a way to choose its support |
